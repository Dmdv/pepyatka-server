Everyone loves pull requests, so here's a quick guide:

- Fork a repository;
- Setup a project and make sure all tests pass;
- Change the code and write a test;
- Double check that all tests still pass;
- Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

After this maintainers will review the code and if not accept will comment on it. After all parties agree we'll merge that pull request into the main line.

You might want to review [Code style](https://github.com/epicmonkey/pepyatka/wiki/Code-style) before doing any real work.
